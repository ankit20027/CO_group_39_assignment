Starter repository for Computer Organization, Monsoon 2021 semester, assignment at IIITD

## About code
* The assembler code is in the `Simple-Assembler` directory. The commands to execute the assembler is `Simple-Assembler/run`.
* The simulator code in the `SimpleSimulator` directory. The commands to execute the assembler is `SimpleSimulator/run`.
* Both the assembler and the simulator read from `stdin` and writes to `stdout`.

## Some tests
* Go to the `Testing` directory to find some test cases for both assembler and simulator.

## Checking memory access
* Plot with the cycle number (x-axis) and the memory address (y-axis). To check which memory address is accessed at what cycle.
* Conclusion from plot: Memory addresses near to fetched address are more likely to be fetched.
